#' Randomize a binary matrix using Fastball
#'
#' `fastball` randomizes a 0/1 matrix, preserving the row and column sums
#'
#' @param B matrix: a 0/1 matrix
#' @param R integer: number of rows in `B`
#' @param C integer: number of columns in `B`
#'
#' @return a 0/1 matrix randomly sampled from the space of all 0/1 matrices with the same row and column sums as B
#'
#' @details `fastball` is an optimized C++ implementation of the curveball algorithm for generating random
#'    0/1 matrices. If `fastball` is used in a loop to randomly sample from the space of all 0/1 matrices
#'    with the row and column sums as `B`, it is faster if `B` is supplied as an indexed list of the locations
#'    of the 1s, which can be generated using `apply(B==1, 1, which)`. This indexed list should be generated just
#'    once, outside the loop. When `B` is supplied as an indexed list, `R` and `C` must be specified.
#'
#' @details To maximize speed, `fastball` does not perform any parameter checks.
